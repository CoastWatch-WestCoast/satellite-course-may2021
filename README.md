# Preface

The [NOAA CoastWatch program](https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/index.html) organizes online and in person satellite course every year, following the model developed in 2006 by Cara Wilson and Dave Foley from [CoastWatch West Coast](https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/courses/satellite_course.html). The goal of the course is to familiarize NOAA/university researchers and students with different types of ocean satellite data, different tools, and teach participants how to use satellite data in their own research using their choice of software (e.g. R, python, ArcGIS). The course is a mix of lectures, tutorials and hands-on computer work on individual projects. All course materials were developed and adapted over the years by:

# NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch/PolarWatch Program
NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch/PolarWatch provides easy access for everyone to global and regional satellite data products for use in understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources, and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate.
