# Tutorials

These exercises are materials for the NOAA Satellite Training Course offered each year by regional nodes of NOAA’s CoastWatch program. They demonstrate tools and techniques useful for working with satellite data.

## NOAA CoastWatch/OceanWatch Program

NOAA [CoastWatch/OceanWatch/PolarWatch](https://coastwatch.noaa.gov/cw/index.html) provides easy access for everyone to global and regional satellite data products for use in understanding, managing and protecting ocean and coastal resources and for assessing impacts of environmental change in ecosystems, weather, and climate.
